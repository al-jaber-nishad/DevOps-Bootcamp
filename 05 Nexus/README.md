2. Click on **Repositories** in the left sidebar.
3. Click on the **Create repository** button.
4. Choose the type of repository you want to create (e.g., Maven2 hosted).
5. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name**: A unique name for your repository.
   - **Blob Store**: Select or create a blob store where artifacts will be stored.
6. Click on **Create repository**.

## 5. Managing Artifacts

### Deploying Artifacts

To deploy an artifact:

1. Use the following command with Maven:
```
mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=com.example
-DartifactId=my-artifact
-Dversion=1.0
-Dpackaging=jar
-Dfile=path/to/my-artifact.jar
-DrepositoryId=nexus-repo
-Durl=http://localhost:8081/nexus/repository/my-repo/
```



### Retrieving Artifacts

You can retrieve artifacts from Nexus using Maven or other build tools by specifying the repository URL in your projectâ€™s configuration file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven).

## 6. Integrating with CI/CD Tools

Nexus integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Bamboo, and TeamCity:

- Configure your CI/CD tool to use Nexus as a repository for dependencies and artifacts.
- Set up build jobs to publish artifacts to Nexus upon successful builds.

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

Regularly monitor your Nexus instance for performance issues and perform maintenance tasks such as:

- Cleaning up unused artifacts.
- Backing up your repository data.
- Upgrading Nexus to the latest version for new features and security updates.
